# Instructions for Creating a `current_project.md` File

## Introduction
The `current_project.md` file is a critical tool for long-form software development collaborations. It serves as a "hard drive" that stores the context and progress of the project, enabling smooth stop-and-continue flows. This document provides instructions on how to structure a `current_project.md` file.

## Structure of `current_project.md`

### Project Title
Start with a title that clearly identifies the project.

### Task Description
Provide a brief description of the project's goal. This should include the main tasks and the expected outcome.

### Task List
List all the tasks that need to be completed for the project. For each task, provide a brief description and any specific requirements. It's helpful to break down large tasks into smaller subtasks.

### Cross-File Dependencies
List all the files that are relevant to the project. For each file, provide a brief description of its role in the project.

### Note
Include any additional information that is important for the project. This could be guidelines, best practices, or any other relevant details.

### Progress Tracking
Create a checklist to track the progress of each task. This will provide a clear visual representation of what has been completed and what is still pending.

### Context
Explain the purpose of the `current_project.md` file. This is to maintain context across multiple sessions, especially if there are interruptions.

## Updating `current_project.md`
The `current_project.md` file should be updated regularly to reflect the current state of the project. This includes marking tasks as completed in the progress tracking section, adding new tasks as they come up, and updating the context as needed. Before starting a new task, a proper audit of the last task and all subtasks should be conducted to ensure they were properly implemented, and that nothing broke due to edits to the files.

When proposing code changes, ensure that the "below the line" section of an edit block contains the updated code, not just the new additions. If the existing code is not included, it would be removed. This is particularly important when working with large blocks of code or entire classes.

## Conclusion
The `current_project.md` file is a powerful tool for managing long-form software development collaborations. By following these instructions, you can create a `current_project.md` file that effectively tracks the progress and maintains the context of your project.
